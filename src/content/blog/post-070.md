Headless CMS platforms separate content management from content presentation. Editors work in a familiar editing interface while developers have complete freedom over how and where the content is displayed.

Astro's content collections are a natural fit for headless CMS content. Using a CMS's REST or GraphQL API, you can fetch content at build time and transform it into Astro's content format. Many CMS platforms have official Astro integrations.

Webhook-triggered rebuilds ensure your site stays up to date when content changes. Configure your CMS to send a webhook to your deployment platform when content is published, triggering a fresh build automatically. The content is fresh, the site is still static.
