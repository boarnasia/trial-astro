A shared component library centralizes your UI building blocks so they can be used consistently across multiple applications. The key decisions are technology choice, versioning strategy, and documentation approach.

Choosing the right tooling for a component library depends on your target consumers. If all your applications use the same framework, framework-specific components are fine. For cross-framework use, Web Components or headless components that separate logic from rendering provide the most flexibility.

Versioning strategy matters enormously for adoption. Too many breaking changes and teams avoid upgrading, leading to divergence. A clear deprecation policy, automated migration tools, and a changelog that explains the reason for changes help teams stay current.
