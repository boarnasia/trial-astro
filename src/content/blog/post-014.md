Deploying an Astro site to Vercel is one of the easiest deployments in web development. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it automatically detects Astro and configures the build settings. Every push to main triggers a new deployment.

For static Astro sites, no adapter is needed — Vercel builds and serves the output directory directly. For server-side rendering, install the @astrojs/vercel adapter and Vercel handles the serverless functions automatically.

Environment variables are managed in the Vercel dashboard and injected at build time. Vercel also provides preview deployments for every pull request, making it easy to review changes before merging.
