React Context API provides a way to share values throughout a component tree without passing props at every level. It is built into React and requires no additional libraries.

Context is ideal for genuinely global data: the current user, theme, locale, or feature flags. It is not ideal for frequently changing state that many components subscribe to — every context update re-renders all consumers.

Redux Toolkit addresses Context's performance limitations with a selective subscription model. Components subscribe only to slices of state they use, so unrelated updates do not cause re-renders. The tradeoff is additional complexity and boilerplate, which makes Redux overkill for small to medium applications.
