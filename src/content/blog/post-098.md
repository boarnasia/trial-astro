CORS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a browser security mechanism that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the page. This prevents malicious sites from making authenticated requests to other sites on behalf of users.

The browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request before cross-origin requests that might have side effects. The server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin and related headers indicating which origins are allowed. If the headers are missing or incorrect, the browser blocks the response.

Configuring CORS correctly means allowing only the origins you intend to serve while refusing others. Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * is a legitimate choice for public APIs but inappropriate for authenticated endpoints. Always configure CORS on the server — browsers enforce it, but it is not a security feature of the server.
