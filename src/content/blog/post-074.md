The View Transitions API enables smooth, animated transitions between page states or routes with very little code. In its simplest form, wrapping a DOM update in document.startViewTransition() creates a cross-fade animation automatically.

Naming elements with view-transition-name connects their before and after states, telling the browser to animate from one position to the other. This creates the shared element transition effect — tapping a card and watching it expand into a detail view — with just CSS.

Astro has built-in support for View Transitions through the ViewTransitions component. Adding it to your layout enables animated page transitions across the entire site, with fallback for browsers that do not yet support the API.
