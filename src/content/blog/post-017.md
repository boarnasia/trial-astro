GitHub Actions automates software workflows directly in your repository. YAML workflow files in .github/workflows/ define triggers — push, pull_request, schedule — and the steps to run in response.

A typical frontend workflow runs on every pull request: install dependencies, run linting, execute tests, and build the project. If any step fails, the PR is blocked from merging, ensuring the main branch always builds cleanly.

Actions from the marketplace let you add capabilities without writing custom scripts. Popular actions handle Node.js setup, caching node_modules, deploying to various platforms, and sending notifications. The cache action alone can cut CI times in half.
