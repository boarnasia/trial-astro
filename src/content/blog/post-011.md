A type-safe API ensures that both the request shape and response shape are fully typed, catching mismatches at compile time rather than at runtime in production. TypeScript makes this achievable with interfaces or Zod schemas.

For REST APIs, you can define request and response types as TypeScript interfaces and use generic fetch wrappers that enforce the correct types. Libraries like tRPC take this further, sharing types between client and server automatically.

Validation at runtime is just as important as compile-time types. Libraries like Zod let you define schemas that both validate data at runtime and infer TypeScript types, giving you the best of both worlds without writing types twice.
