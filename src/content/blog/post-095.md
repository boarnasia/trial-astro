Progressive Web Apps combine the best of web and native apps: they are discovered through the web, but can be installed on the home screen, work offline, and send push notifications. The core technologies are the web app manifest and service workers.

The web app manifest is a JSON file that defines the app's name, icons, theme color, and display mode. It tells the browser how to present the app when installed. The display: standalone value removes the browser chrome, making the app feel native.

Offline support requires thoughtful caching strategy. Assets that never change — the app shell — can be cached indefinitely. Dynamic content requires a strategy: serve from cache first for speed, or network first for freshness, with a fallback for offline states.
