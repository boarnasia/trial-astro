Single-page applications present unique accessibility challenges because the browser's built-in navigation behaviors — scrolling to the top on page load, announcing the new page title — do not occur during route changes.

Route change announcements require a live region — an element with aria-live='polite' — that announces the new page title when navigation occurs. Most routing libraries do not implement this automatically, so it must be added explicitly.

Focus management on route change is equally important. Some patterns move focus to the main content area, while others focus the page heading. The key is that focus moves somewhere meaningful — not lost to the document body — and that the new content is available in the DOM at the time focus moves.
