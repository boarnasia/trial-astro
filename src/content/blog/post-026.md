TypeScript generics allow you to write functions and data structures that work with multiple types while maintaining full type safety. They are one of TypeScript's most powerful features and enable highly reusable, flexible code.

A generic function uses a type parameter, typically written as T, that gets resolved when the function is called. TypeScript often infers the type parameter automatically, so you rarely need to specify it explicitly.

Generic constraints, written with the extends keyword, restrict which types can be used as a type argument. This lets you access properties that might not exist on every possible type. Understanding constraints is the key to writing generic code that is both flexible and type-safe.
