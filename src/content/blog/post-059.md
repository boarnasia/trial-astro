Playwright is a modern end-to-end testing framework that supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Its auto-wait mechanism waits for elements to be actionable before interacting with them, eliminating most of the flakiness that plagues older testing tools.

Page Object Models keep test code maintainable by abstracting page interactions into reusable classes. Instead of selector strings scattered throughout tests, each page is represented by a class with methods that describe user actions.

Playwright's trace viewer provides a visual recording of test execution including screenshots, network requests, and console logs. When a test fails in CI, the trace makes debugging possible without reproducing the issue locally.
