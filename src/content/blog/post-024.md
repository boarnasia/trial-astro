Web Components are a set of browser-native APIs for creating reusable custom elements. Unlike React or Vue components, Web Components work in any context — plain HTML pages, WordPress themes, or alongside any JavaScript framework.

Custom elements are defined by extending HTMLElement and registering with customElements.define(). Shadow DOM provides style encapsulation so your component styles cannot leak out or be accidentally overridden by page styles.

HTML templates — the template element — let you define markup that is not rendered until cloned and inserted into the document. Web Components are gaining traction as a foundation for design systems that need to work across multiple frameworks.
