Modern CSS color functions provide more expressive and perceptually uniform ways to work with color. The oklch function defines colors using lightness, chroma, and hue in the Oklab color space, which aligns better with human color perception than HSL.

The color-mix() function blends two colors in any color space, providing a CSS-native way to create tints and shades without preprocessors. color-mix(in oklch, blue 50%, white) produces a perceptually even mix that looks like a natural blend.

The light-dark() function takes two values and returns the first in light mode and the second in dark mode, based on the prefers-color-scheme media query or the color-scheme property. This is the simplest possible way to implement dark mode in CSS.
