Lighthouse is a free, open-source tool for auditing web page quality. It tests performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, providing actionable recommendations for each category.

The Performance score is based on a weighted average of six metrics including LCP, Total Blocking Time, and CLS. Each metric provides specific guidance on what to fix. The Opportunities section shows the most impactful changes you can make.

Running Lighthouse in CI using the Lighthouse CI package prevents performance regressions from reaching production. You can set budgets for each metric and fail the build if they are exceeded. Tracking scores over time reveals trends that point-in-time testing would miss.
