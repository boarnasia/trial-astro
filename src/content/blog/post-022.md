Asynchronous JavaScript has evolved from callbacks to Promises to async/await, each iteration making asynchronous code easier to reason about. Async/await is now the standard way to write asynchronous code in modern JavaScript.

An async function always returns a Promise, even if you return a plain value. The await keyword pauses execution of the async function until the Promise resolves, but it does not block the main thread — other code continues running.

Error handling with async/await uses try/catch blocks, which makes it feel much like synchronous error handling. For running multiple independent async operations in parallel, Promise.all() is essential — awaiting them sequentially when they are independent wastes time.
