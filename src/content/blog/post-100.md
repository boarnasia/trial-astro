WebAssembly is a binary instruction format that runs in the browser at near-native speed. It is not a replacement for JavaScript but a complement — most web applications still write their UI logic in JavaScript and use WebAssembly for performance-critical computation.

Languages like Rust, C, and C++ can compile to WebAssembly, bringing existing high-performance libraries to the web. Codecs, image editors, scientific simulations, and game engines are all compelling use cases where WebAssembly shines.

The WebAssembly JavaScript API allows JavaScript and WebAssembly to call each other, share memory, and exchange values. This interoperability means WebAssembly modules can be used as performance-critical pieces of an otherwise JavaScript application without rewriting everything.
