Service workers are JavaScript files that run in the background, separate from the web page. They act as a programmable proxy between the browser and the network, enabling capabilities like offline support, background sync, and push notifications.

The service worker lifecycle — install, activate, and fetch — controls when a new version takes effect. During install, you cache static assets. During activate, you clean up old caches. The fetch event lets you intercept network requests and respond from cache.

Precaching ensures critical assets are available offline from the first load. Runtime caching stores responses as they are fetched, building a local cache progressively. Workbox, a library from Google, provides strategies for common caching patterns without writing boilerplate.
