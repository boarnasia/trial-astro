The JavaScript event loop is what enables non-blocking I/O despite JavaScript being single-threaded. Understanding it explains why setTimeout callbacks, promises, and async/await behave the way they do.

The call stack executes synchronous code. When it encounters asynchronous operations — timers, fetch calls, event listeners — they are delegated to browser APIs. When those operations complete, their callbacks are placed in the appropriate queue.

The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it first processes all microtasks (Promise callbacks), then takes one task from the macrotask queue (setTimeout, setInterval) and executes it. This explains why Promise.resolve().then() runs before setTimeout(() => {}, 0).
