Dark mode support has become an expected feature for modern web applications. Users who prefer dark mode expect it to work across every site they visit, not just the ones that have explicitly designed for it.

The prefers-color-scheme media query detects the user's system preference. CSS custom properties make switching between light and dark themes as simple as redefining a handful of color variables under a media query or a data-theme attribute.

Storing the user's explicit choice in localStorage overrides the system preference. The challenge is avoiding a flash of unstyled content when the page first loads — applying the stored preference before the first render requires a small inline script in the document head.
