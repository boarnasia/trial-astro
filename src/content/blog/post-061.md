The Web Animation API brings CSS animation capabilities to JavaScript with a programmatic interface. Animations created with WAAPI are compositor-thread animations, giving them the same performance characteristics as CSS animations.

The element.animate() method accepts a keyframes array and timing options and returns an Animation object. This object has methods to play, pause, reverse, and seek the animation, enabling complex choreography that is impossible with CSS alone.

The real power of WAAPI is dynamic animations — generating keyframes from data, chaining animations with Promise-based callbacks, and synchronizing multiple animations using a shared timeline. It bridges the gap between simple CSS animations and complex JavaScript animation libraries.
