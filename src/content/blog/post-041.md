Astro's key differentiator is its approach to JavaScript: it ships zero client-side JavaScript by default. Every component, including those written in React or Vue, is rendered to HTML at build time unless you explicitly opt into client-side hydration.

Content collections are Astro's system for organizing and querying content files like blog posts. Defining a schema for your collection adds type safety to frontmatter, validates content at build time, and provides typed query results.

Astro integrations extend the framework with support for React, Tailwind, MDX, sitemaps, and more. The integration API is simple enough that creating custom integrations is approachable for most developers.
